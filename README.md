## Description
The Credit Card Risk Predictive Analysis project involves building a predictive model to assess the risk of credit card clients. The model determines if a client is "good" or "bad" based on various features.

## Installation
To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/credit-card-risk-predictive-analysis.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd credit-card-risk-predictive-analysis
    ```
3. Create a new environment (optional but recommended):
    ```bash
    python -m venv env
    ```
4. Activate the environment:
    - On Windows:
        ```bash
        .\env\Scripts\activate
        ```
    - On macOS and Linux:
        ```bash
        source env/bin/activate
        ```
5. Install the required packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage
The project utilizes a Kaggle dataset for predicting credit card approval. You can download the dataset from [here](#).

1. Download the dataset and place it in the `data/` directory.
2. Run the analysis script:
    ```bash
    python analysis.py
    ```

## Features
- Predicts the risk category (good/bad) of credit card clients.
- Uses various features for prediction.
- Includes data preprocessing and model evaluation.

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome! Please follow these steps to contribute:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch:
    ```bash
    git checkout -b feature-branch
    ```
3. Make your changes.
4. Commit your changes:
    ```bash
    git commit -m "Add some feature"
    ```
5. Push to the branch:
    ```bash
    git push origin feature-branch
    ```
6. Create a pull request.
